                    <h2>What is Sister's Clarinet?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sister's Clarinet is a company dedicated to building
                        unbearably cheap environments in order to teach people
                        across the U.S. how to play the classic wind instrument:
                        the clarinet. Starting this year, we are offering a
                        25 percent discount for all of our customers!
                    </p>
                    <h2>Benefits of Taking Classes</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We are cheaper than any other clarinet building we
                            could locate so far.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The thermostat is frequently checked to make sure
                            the environment is &lpar;somewhat&rpar; tolerable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The rooms are mostly cleared out, including chairs
                            and tables. This eliminates distractions and other
                            interferences.
