                        Each building has individual classrooms focusing on
                        different elements of playing the clarinet. It may sound
                        inefficient, because it is, but if you didn't notice our
                        one-and-a-half star reviews on the web, chances are
                        it'll be your fault for signing up without prior
                        knowledge of this company's incompetence. The following
                        classrooms and their subjects are as follows:

                                While this may sound silly, breathing is
                                actually important to live. All joking aside,
                                this room is specifically designed to help you
                                meditate and prepare for your lessons and trips.

                                while playing your clarinet. You will be
                                learning about concepts like quarter notes,
                                eighth rests, major scales, and more.

                                remember how to read music during this, because
                                we don't pass out music sheets in this room
                                except for special occasions.
